I am taking this course since it is a requirement for my Web Development degree. I have no background with server-side scripting and honestly I am finding a little challenging the whole
setup for this course. I hope things get easier the more I learn in this course. I chose the JavaScript language because it is very popular and high in demand according to the survey
and also because I started my journey with JavaScript last semester.
