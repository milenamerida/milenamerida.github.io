    <h1>Internet Protocol</h1>
    <p>
      The topic of internet protocol is divided by different nomenclatures. Throughout the article we can notice that there are reliable and unreliable protocols 
      and sometimes they need to be paired up to be able to complete the job. Starting with TCP (transmission control protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol 
      and acts as back bone for connection. It offers stream data transfer, reliability, and efficient flow control. The IP (internet protocol) in a connectionless 
      and unreliable protocol. Meaning that it does not ensure successful transmission of data, and in order to make it reliable it should be paired with a 
      reliable protocol such as TCP. The UDP (user datagram protocol) is also a connectionless and unreliable protocol, and its job is to transfer the data in form 
      of a datagram. The FTP (file transfer protocol) is used to copy files from one host to another, using the combined IP and TCP. And lastly, the HTTP (hyper 
      text transfer protocol) is a communication protocol, defining communication between browser and the web server. This article really helped me open my mind 
      about the protocols, since I have not learned anything like this before. Now when I use the internet I know what types of protocols might be happening in the 
      background.

    <h1>Internet Domain Name System</h1>
    <p>
      According to the article on Internet Domain Name System, or also known as DNS, the DNS was invented to solve the high traffic on downloading the host file 
      and their corresponding IP address to access a website. The DNS works by correlating the name and the distributed database of IP addresses. The IP address 
      is a unique logical address assigned to a machine over the network and consists of two components: network component and the host component. Now to refer to 
      the web address it is used the URL (Unifor Resource Locator), and there are two different types of URL: the absolute URL and the relative URL. The absolute 
      URL consists of the full address of a resource on the web and the relative URL is a partial address of a page. The DNS architecture is divided by domain 
      names, domain name space and name server. The domain name is a symbolic string associated with an IP address, generic ones such as com, edu, gov, net etc, 
      and country level ones such as us, in, au, es etc. I notice this when I am logging in my harper account where the domain name is edu, while when I log in my 
      regular email the domain is com. And websites from my home country, for example, end in br. The domain name space refers to a hierarchy in the internet 
      structure, and it has multiple levels (from 0 to 127). The name server contains the DNS database. I did not know how and why some domain names changed, and 
      now I understand.
