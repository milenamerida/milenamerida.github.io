            On this assignment I learned how important it is to take into consideration the accessibility to the website
            I am
            designing. There are different types of impairments such as visual, hearing, mobility and cognitive. Each
            one has its
            own specificities and a “solution” to the visitor. It is crucial to learn and know how to include everyone,
            especially nowadays that we have such an advanced technology, so now that I am learning how to code I am
            also making
            a priority to keep accessibility in mind because everyone deserve to have access to the internet.
