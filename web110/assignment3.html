    <h1>Email</h1>
    <p>
      Under email basics there was a topic about email etiquette and safety, which is very important in both professional and personal lives. Some tips shown in this article to achieve 
      email success are including a greeting in the beginning and ending of email, including a relevant subject line helps the recipient know what the message is about as well as being 
      concise in the message (providing enough detail without rambling), paying attention to the tone used to write the message and the list of recipients, and reviewing the message 
      before sending. I often use all of these before sending an email, especially when I am at work or reaching a professor for one of my classes. Attachments are very helpful when 
      sending or receiving emails, but it is important to remember to mention the attachments in the message and make sure that the files are attached before sending - a common mistake 
      is realizing the files were not attached after sending it (this happened a few times with me). It is also very important to pay attention to your safety in emails, for example 
      avoid sharing sensitive information (such as credit card and social security), make sure the emails you are receiving are from the actual person or institution and avoid phishing 
      - scammers pretend to be a person/institution in order to steal your personal information. Linking the topic to the previous article about phishing, in another article I learned 
      more about email spoofing which defines creating messages with a forged sender address. In this case, because the email address is not actually the senderâ€™s, replies might bounce 
      or be delivered to an unrelated party (whose ID was faked). Email services are not capable of authenticating the source of emails, and that is why it may happen.

    <h1>Social Media</h1>
    <p>
      I am an avid social media user and I access my Instagram and TikTok accounts everyday, and because I now live in a different country I use social media to stay connected to my 
      family and friends back in my home country. Social media is very popular to share pictures and videos, and like I mentioned before, to keep in touch with friends; and although 
      social media can be harmful in some ways, nowadays it is the most used form of communication all around the world. Social media can also be used to find jobs, like indeed and 
      linkedin. And a very important point is that you can have access to the news online over social media, which makes it easier to spread information but it is crucial to use 
      critical thinking when consuming this type of information.

    <h1>Communications</h1>
    <p>
      I mentioned earlier in this assignment that I am from another country and that I use social media to communicate with family and friends. Another type of online communication I 
      use everyday is WhatsApp. WhatsApps is an application where users can share text messages, images and videos, voice messages, calls and video calls. It is simple to set up and use 
      the many features included in it. WhatsApp requires only a connection to the internet, so even if you do not have service but are still able to connect to a WiFi, you are able to 
      communicate. I am really grateful that this application exists, so I can reach my whole family and my closest friends anytime I want.
