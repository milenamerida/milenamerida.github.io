    <h1>Internet Safety</h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    Under the topic of internet safety, I learned that because there is almost no limit to what can be done online, it
    is crucial to adopt a safer mindset. This means that we should keep in mind that there is no
    reason to be afraid of the internet, but it can bring many risks (just like the ones we face in the real world).
    Some of the steps we can do to keep ourselves safe on the internet are creating strong
    passwords and browser security features. To start we need passwords for basically everything on the internet, and
    that is why we need to be aware of what we use as a password. It shouldn’t have personal
    information (which could be easy for someone else to guess), passwords should be at least six characters long,
    random passwords are the strongest and we should include numbers, symbols, uppercase and
    lowercase letters. A very common mistake that people do is using the same password for everything, and this is not
    ideal. I use different passwords for different websites, and I try to include at least one
    symbol and numbers, so it makes it stronger. Another feature that we should pay attention to is the browser’s
    security. It doesn’t matter which browser we use; we must be aware of the web address and avoid
    deceptive web addresses, pay attention to the security symbol which shows a lock in the address bar meaning that
    there is an extra layer of security, and lastly keep our browser up to date to avoid new
    viruses and malware.

    In the topic of internet security, I learned the difference between two security protocols, the internet security
    protocol (IPSec) and the secure locket layer (SSL). The first, IPSec, provides security at
    network level and helps to create authenticated and confidential packets for IP layer, and it consists of protocols
    made by the internet engineering task force (IETF). The second, SSL, provides security at
    transport layer such as privacy, integrity, and authentication; and its security protocol is developed by Netscape
    communications corporation. We also need to be aware of threats and how they impact the
    network, data security and other internet connected systems. Some examples are email phishing (where scammers send
    emails to users claiming to be a legitimate enterprise and its main purpose is to steal
    sensitive information), malware and spam. I am always aware of the emails I receive and I check the sender’s address
    and make a research if it is real or not.
