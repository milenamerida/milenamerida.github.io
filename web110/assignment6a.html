      On this assignment I practiced inserting images, audios and an iframe in a HTML file. I have mentioned before that I am also taking WEB150 during the summer, and in that class 
      I have used the <img> tag many times, so to include this AI generated image was not difficult. But the other tags, <audio> and <iframe> I had to do some research in order to add 
        it. In my opinion the <iframe> tag is helpful when used properly and it makes the website look nicer. The audio tag is not my favorite, especially thinking about being user 
          friendly, you either take the control from the visitor or you make them reach for another button to have the full experience of that web page.
