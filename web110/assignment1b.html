    <h1>
      Keyboard Shortcuts
    </h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    In this activity I learned some keyboard shortcuts, which comes in handy on a daily basis. I found this article very
    helpful because it shows shortcuts in both windows and macOS
    and that really helps me since I have access to both operating systems; personally I have a macbook and at work use
    a windows PC. I have had access to windows for a longer time
    than to macOS so I have a harder time knowing the shortcuts on my laptop and one of the first things the article
    talks about is hovering the mouse cursor over the buttons in an
    application to find its shortcut. This is something very simple but it’s not a habit of mine, so from now on I will
    try my best to remember this to make my life easier.
    I already knew most of the shortcuts for texts and files, but I learned the shortcut to open an existing file, and I
    will use a lot especially when doing homework whenever I
    need to refer to slides and other saved documents. The internet shortcuts were the most helpful in this article. I
    did not know how to open a new tab or new window, how to reload
    a page (this is my personal favorite), or how to save and view my bookmarks. I used to work as an analyst and I
    worked almost exclusively on excel spreadsheets, and that is how
    I learned all my shortcuts for texts and files, although the article did help me remember some that I haven’t used
    in a while. But over the summer I am taking internet
    fundamentals and web foundations and in both classes we are covering HTML and, especially now in the beginning,
    after some changes in the code we have to refresh the page to see
    what changed on the web browser. From now on I won’t have to reach for my mouse to refresh the page, I can use the
    shortcut to change applications (alt+tab or command+tab) and
    the shortcut to refresh (control+R or command+R).

      Managing Folders and Files
    </h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    In this article I learned how to manage my files and folders in my finder. I chose this article because, as I
    mentioned in the previous description, I have a macbook and I dont
    have much knowledge on how to use it since I have had it for a short time. Changing from windows to macOS can be
    challenging, especially at this time in school where organization
    is key for success. In this article they go over some shortcuts that weren’t mentioned in the previous article, and
    also how to move files from one folder to another. The column
    view for the finder application is really helpful and it will definitely make my study time easier. With this option
    I am able to visualize the contents of multiple folders and
    subfolders, facilitating reorganization of files. The reason why this is going to be helpful is that when creating
    the folders for my classes I can see the HTML file, CSS file,
    and image folder from each class; though I am sure this will also be helpful in my career when working on client’s
    projects. I like to keep my documents organized in separate
    folders for each class and assignment. In the finder application I am able to tag my documents with different colors
    and then filter that color, which will allow me to see every
    folder and file I tagged at once. This is going to be helpful to filter assignments due on the same day, big
    projects, and finals to name a few. And I also really like the fact
    that I can customize my side bar and display only the folders that make sense to me and lessen clutter; something
    that I really appreciate, considering the fact that I do not
    like to work with clutter (both physical and digital).
