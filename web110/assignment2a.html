      Internet Tips Activity
      This session focused more on web browsers and their functionalities, and the difference between web browsers and search engines. Many people might get confused with what is a web 
      browser and what is a search engine, and the article made it easy to differentiate: search engine is where one would type the website, or use it to find some information, as the 
      web browser is what supports this search engine. Under the activity “Internet Tips” there is an article where it guides the user to find the best browser for the device they are 
      using. With an interactive graph the user can select the device (such as Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, and others) and check what browser is available and which one works best 
      for that particular device. In my case I choose to use Google Chrome on my personal laptop and work computer and Safari on my phone, since it is the default browser and it gets 
      the job done. Under the same article there is an explanation on cache and how to clear it from your browser. Basically whenever we are browsing the internet the web browser saves 
      information in order to make the experience faster. It can save login information, preferences, images, videos, and other types of data. And even though saving this data is 
      helpful, it could cause some issues, such as: not displaying the most recent version of the website, and preventing certain parts of the website from loading correctly. And the 
      process to clear the cache is simple and quick.

      Web Browser Activity
      Now, under the activity “Web Browser” there is an article explaining how browsers work, the different options the user have, and some tips on how to use it. The part that I liked 
      the most about this article is the explanation of the architecture of a web browser. It starts listing the basic components of any web browser: controller, interpreter, and client 
      programs; all working toward interpreting and displaying information. The controller is responsible for taking the input from the mouse or keyboard and interpreting it to work 
      based on the input received. The interpreter receives the information from the controller and executes it line by line. And last one are the client programs that will describe the 
      specific protocol to be used to access the service (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and others). What I really liked about this part of the article was the diagram, showing the process explained 
      above in a workflow, in which I can see exactly what I am learning this summer.
