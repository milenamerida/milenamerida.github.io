    <h1>Unordered Lists</h1>
    <p>
      On this assignment I got to apply an unordered list to my HTML. I learned this in my WEB150 class, so it was easier to code this web page, but it is not easy to do yet. I forgot 
      the <a> tag to use href for the assignment links, but now I will use it as an example to always remember. I also had a hard time with testing my web page from GitHub, as I know 
        how to do it from VS Code because of my other class. But once I watched the videos, I learned how to do that as well. It is very useful to learn it since many websites require 
        lists.
