    <h1>HTML Basics</h1>
    <p>
        This semester I learned a lot about the internet and web development, and all the things that are 
        behind the computer screen that we don't realize on a daily basis. Learning about HTML, CSS, databases and
        SQL opened my mind to web development and I am very glad I took this course since I learned a lot with the 
        material and my peers.
