    <h1>Search Better</h1>
    <p>
      In this article I learned more about search engines and how to improve my experience when searching things online. Different search engines mainly work the same way, and may 
      present small differences when it comes to the results of the same search. This happens because of the way each search engine operates and the frequency it interacts with 
      webpages. The most popular search engines are Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. I use Google exclusively, mainly because it is user-friendly and the benefit that everything is connected 
      to my Google account makes it very convenient. In this article I found tips for search strategies that will make my search more effective, and these tips can be used in any 
      search engine. Firstly, it is not necessary to over-explain your search, keeping it short and using keywords will be enough to find good results. Secondly, search engines often 
      will suggest popular results for that search and that can be helpful. From my own experience, this is a great tip specially because it gives me new ideas to my search and helps 
      me expand my horizons. And lastly, the search engines understand natural language, so it is not necessary to use complicated words or phrases to find the answer to a question. 
      In this same article there is a list of hidden features of Google, and I use it repeatedly for conversions - coming from a different country to the United States can be hard to 
      understand distances and measurements and Google definitely helps me with it.

    <h1>AI vs Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
      In this video Jeff Crume explains the differences and relationship between artificial intelligence versus machine learning. The most common questions about both of them are: is it 
      AI versus ML, or AI equal to ML, or AI different to ML? Crume starts explaining that AI is either exceeding or matching the human capability of discovering new information, being 
      able to understand something that is not bluntly explicit (like a text), and being able to figure things out. Whereas machine learning is capable of making decisions and 
      predictions based on data, using statistical analysis. Crume also goes deeper in machine learning, to a more specific part called deep learning, which is a process where it tries 
      to mimic the human brain and match its capabilities. It may not be fully trustworthy, due to the fact that we don’t know where that information came from. He ends by emphasizing 
      that the questions brought in the beginning are not the rightful way of thinking about AI and ML’s relationship. We should consider ML as a subset of AI.
