        On this assignment I used CSS to style my HTML assignments. CSS is used to change the appearance of the website, such as background 
        color and font color, size and family. With this assignment I practiced more how to apply CSS to different HTMLs. I also learned how 
        to use CSS inline, which I have never done before and it was good to practice as well. CSS can be scary at first, but once we realize 
        how helpful and how amazing the website turns out using CSS, it makes a lot easier to get used to it.
