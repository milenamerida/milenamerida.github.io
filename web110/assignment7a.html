            For my project I will talk about HTML and how to create a website with it. I will also be using Visual Studio 
            Code, since it is the software I am using to learn how to code. My plan is to explain the basics and show in 
            the video how coding HTML works (a basic website).
            My project will be called: HTML basics with VS Code.
